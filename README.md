# Red-Eyed Rampage
## UnSX Side Story: Saya

---

## What?

Hey what if you played as **Saya** wouldn't that be really cool and fun?

Now seriously, I feel like making separate mods for each **SWWM GZ** companion would result in some very interesting opportunities to experiment with other playstyles.

So, basically the story here is simple. Everyone knows that **Saya** just sits back and watches as others do all the fighting for her, right? She's just lazy, a coward, that's what everyone says. And the words of those people, they hurt. She can't help but feel like they're right. So why not shut them all up by going out there and kicking some ass by yourself? Yeah, there's no way this will go wrong, or cause you some form of long-lasting trauma...

## Abilities

**Saya** has inherited not just the immortal blood of two individuals who have imbibed the **Hourai Elixir**, but also their very powers themselves, and their fighting spirit. Despite being so small and frail looking, she's a natural at moving quickly, dashing and dodging. She's definitely got quite a lot of strength in those legs of her, which is also useful in close combat. Apart from the physical aspects, she's of course also proficient in spellcasting, but also being a gun nut as she is means she won't just use magic to defend herself, but also various weapons of her own choosing. Do note that unlike the very robotic **Demolitionist**, she's a human, and as such will succumb to falling from great heights, poison and drowning.

One must be reminded that the **Hourai Elixir** grants an individual what's basically *"divine immortality"*, that is, the ability to recover from death, even if the entire body itself is destroyed, for all of eternity. Even if demons tear your flesh to ribbons, you will return, angrier and more vengeful than before. Merely dying lets you get back up on the spot after a short while, but should you be reduced to nothing but a fine red mist, a new *"you"* will be reborn nearby, somehow **still wearing clothes** *(Yeah, that's something very peculiar about this phenomenon)*.

Keep in mind, however, that if you die a horrible death and have to *"respawn"*, all your stuff will remain in the backpack you had in your previous body, so you'll need to recover it. *(Note: For the sake of gameplay sanity, keys don't get taken away)*

Do note that you are very squishy, but you can try again and again no matter how many times you die. The game is over when **YOU** give up.

---

## Weaponry

As a civilian, **Saya** shouldn't be carrying any weapons, but who's going to stop her? All that time playing games, watching videos, and even toying with some guns at the range should definitely pay off in being able to wield any weapon she can find lying out there. And of course, she's also not afraid to punch and kick her way to victory, especially when the **Houraisan** blood in her makes her specifically very proficient at dealing maximum damage to a person's crotch *(ü•Åü•Åüé∏)*.

The operation of all weapons is fairly simple: Primary fire shoots, secondary fire aims down the sights, and reload... reloads. **Saya** uses a civilian type Hammerspace container, so automatic mag management isn't provided, you'll have to do it yourself.

### Slot 1 - Unarmed *[Fist, Chainsaw]*

*"Say goodbye to your future generations, scum."*

Raise up your fists to attack the opponent. It may not be very effective, usually, but even the mightiest tree can be felled with enough perseverance. Primary fire alternates between quick jabs of each hand. Secondary fire performs a kick *(stronger if aimed at the enemy's crotch, if it has one)*.

Note: Taking the place of the **Chainsaw** are a pair of **Brass Knuckles**, which will permanently enhance your punching damage.

### Slot 2 - Shinigami NK23 *[Pistol]*

*"Ah, the **Nyan23**, one of the first gun girls I married."*

Based loosely on **Heckler & Mok**'s **USP** family of firearms, the .45 AVP **Neko23** offers a lot of opportunities to deal some damage. Each bullet that comes out of this kitty will be imbued with fiery passion, dealing some extra burn. You've got 12 bullets in the mag, more than enough to efficiently eliminate hellish vermin.

#### .45 AVP Mags *[Clip, Bullet Box]*

Just scattered around, sometimes in bunches.

### Slot 3 - Ninnacht IDW *[Shotgun]*

*"Why does everyone hate the cute cat? ... Da nya~‚òÜ"*

A promising little gun that was lucky enough to be saved from disaster when **Ninnacht Armaments** managed to buy all rights to its design and development. Light, fast, and very catty. 9mm Parabellum, 32 rounds, and a steady fire rate of 300 RPM. A fairly decent choice for a small girl like **Saya**.

#### 9mm Parabellum Mags *[Shells, Shell Box]*

Pretty much strewn about the place, like everything else. You can start to tell by now that **Cyrus** didn't put as much effort into carefully deploying equipment as he used to during the **Demolitionist** missions.

### Slot 4 - Siesta "Goldsmith" Sawed off *[Super Shotgun]*

*"Èóá„ÇíÂàá„ÇäË£Ç„Åè„ÄÅÔºØÔº®„ÄÄÔº§Ôº•Ôº≥Ôº©Ôº≤Ôº•„ÄúÔºÅ"*

Chambered for .45LV, this *"relic"* has been in **Saya**'s private collection since the early days. She likes taking it to the range and attempting to cycle it *"the cool way"* while she pretends to shoot down *"goat servants"* or something. Well, now she can definitely shoot some goats with it, for sure.

Can hold 4 rounds plus one in the chamber. Fairly useful for stopping hell nobles in their tracks.

#### .45LV Rounds *[Shells, Shell Box]*

Will pop up either scattered around or in packs.

### Slot 5 - Akari "Hyperion" Gauss Rifle *[Chaingun]*

*"The future is in electromagnetic weapons, not that caseless bullshit from **Volt**."*

One of the very first specialized coilguns built at **Akari Labs**. **Saya** herself considers it *"stupid"* to call it a *"gauss rifle"*, citing that such a name is *"just sci-fi mumbo jumbo"*. This weapon fires magnetized 4mm bolts tipped with a potent shock charge, stunning targets and dealing some nasty pain. With a *"blazing"* fire rate of 420 RPM, this puppy can sure bite hard.

Each mag holds 50 rounds, allowing you to spend a whole seven seconds of firing away without a single interruption.

#### 4mm EC Shock-Tip Bolts *[Clip, Bullet Box]*

Slightly less common than pistol mags, but they may take their place.

### Slot 6 - Shinigami AT44 *[Rocket Launcher]*

*"Protip: Don't try to rocket jump IRL."*

The **Akatsuki 44** is truly a deadly deliverer of destruction, devised mockingly after **H&M**'s blunder with their failed **IAWS** experiment. This is no mere grenade launcher, as in true **Shinigami Inc.** fashion there is a bit of their usual magic at work here. These 25mm airburst grenades are capable of intelligently detonating near hostile targets, or mere moments before impending collision with a wall. Do note that this capability does not take into account personal user safety, so try to keep your distance.

The magazine holds 4 rounds. Four chances to deliver death.

#### 25mm Grenades *[Rocket, Rocket Box]*

You'll either find single rounds or small packs of five.

### Slot 7 - Nekuratek "Nabikuni" *[Plasma Rifle]*

*"I cast fuck you on your sorry ass."*

The *"Verdant Mage"* is one of **Nekuratek**'s few still surviving plasma weapons. Capable of delivering bursts of burning **Dyratin** plasma at a steady 700 RPM, it could be described almost as a *"plasma hose"* of sorts.

Rather than *"rounds"*, the magazine holds 300mL of pressurized Dyratin. 5mL are consumed per shot, so this thing will let you unload steadily for up to 5 seconds before reloading.

#### 300mL Dyratin Cell *[Cell, Cell Pack]*

A handful of plasma, in a can. Or several cans.

### Slot 8 - Cryptik "Malefactor" Plasma Caster *[BFG9000]*

*"Eat flaming neon death."*

Yet another lawsuit that **Cryptik Arms** managed to skillfully dodge, this time coming from the **UAC** themselves. Suspiciously similar to certain prototypes from their **Botis Field Glyph** project, but distinct enough to be its own weapon, the **Malefactor** is a devastating directed energy weapon that releases searing arcs of plasma towards ionized targets. The more targets that are to be struck, the lesser the individual damage may be.

Each "magazine" allows for 8 individual shots, as well as serving to power the entire weapon itself.

#### Caster Feed Module

You'd be lucky to find extra ammo around, unless it's from another BFG spawn.

### Slot X - Ninnacht Jackhammer *[Blursphere]*

*"This fucking thing has no right to exist."*

The weapon that brought **Ninnacht Armaments** to ruin, the most disastrous thing ever conceived. Its very existence is a mistake. A fully automatic 12-gauge shotgun with a 12 shot drum magazine that requires full gun disassembly to replace. Only a couple prototypes were made. Ex-CEO **James Heinen-Bradstenfeldt** suggested at the time that should any remaining prototypes be found, they must immediately be dropped into an active volcano.

**Saya** will simply throw it away after those 12 shots. If you keep it idle for a while, she'll throw it away on her own anyway because it sucks. She also refuses to put it into her inventory, so switching from it also throws it away. She will not pick it back up again afterwards, and you will never see it spawn again ever in that IWAD.

## Spellcasting

As someone of such an upbringing as she is, **Saya** is no stranger to magic. All spells consume mana, which regenerates over time, or can also be recovered by consuming certain items. **Spellcards** of course are also available, and although they will eat up far more of your energy than simple spells, their effects will be far more devastating. In addition, unlike spells, they have a cooldown after each use.

### Pellet

*"Really makes you go pichuun~."*

A basic offensive spell. A steady release of seeker projectiles at a quickened interval. Can be either shot in a scattered form with primary fire, or a focused pattern with secondary fire. This spell consumes very little mana.

### Phoenix Talons

*"Watch out for this gal, I'm gonna slash ya."*

Dancing slashes that cut through flesh. Primary fire and secondary fire merely alternate between the left and right hand. Slightly more mana consumption.

### Love Heart

*"Ah, the power of love, strong enough to kill evil people through sheer disgust."*

Blows a kiss at enemies. Their hatred for you is turned into potent damage. Has the opposite effect on allies, healing them instead. Primary fire alternates between kisses with each hand, while secondary charges up a bigger smooch with both hands. Low mana consumption.

### Spellcard: Rude Sign "Saturation Barrage"

*"What? Like... Just dodge through it, it's not that hard."*

One of the spellcards that got **Saya** banned from duels. The amount of projectiles on display is said to be so dense it's practically impossible to avoid without extreme luck.

Primary fire directs the barrage towards everything in front of you, while secondary fire, will instead cause the barrage to swirl in every direction.

It really is just too much, no wonder people refuse to duel her.

### Spellcard: Reviled Sign "Igneous Lexicon"

*"Words that kill..."*

Blinding trails of hateful energy that burst into very, VERY painful words.

Primary fire will release feeble words for less mana and wider coverage, while secondary fire reserves the nastiest words for really tearing through foes.

All the words seem to be in **English**.

### Spellcard: Retribution Sign "Ride to Hell"

*"This is totally not a reference to anything I swear."*

A steady burst of seeking beams of fiery energy that explode on impact, bursting into deadly heat. Each beam deals exactly 1% of the enemy's total health pool in damage, making this especially effective against heavy targets.

Primary fire shoots them out at a slower pace, while secondary fire does it much faster, but consuming far more mana.

The beams appear to make motorbike revving noises as they travel.

### Spellcard: Radiant Sign "Aureous Flare"

*"Hey, check out how hard I can pee!"*

**Saya**'s most powerful spellcard, and one entirely of her own creation. She claims this rivals even the mighty **Master Spark** in potency. Whether using primary or secondary fire, the effect is all but the same: Upon being charged, a swirling mass of incandescent tendrils will be released in a wide arc, penetrating even the thickest walls, stopping at nothing in their path of destruction.

The main difference between fire modes is that with secondary fire, you can release them in a steady stream, rather than all at once in a deafening blast.

**Saya** seems to always cast this one with both hands at her crotch, index fingers extended, as if mimicking the act of urinating with a penis.

## Items

You can't just go out there and expect to do everything without help. And so, the many items come to play.

### Cookie *[Health Bonus]*

*"Now this is one cookie I wouldn't put down."*

It is said that whoever controls the cookies, may one day control the universe. Each of these heals up for 1 HP, and can push you up to 200 HP with ease.

### Stimmy Pack *[Stimpack]*

*"A stimmy pack, for the small ouchies."*

Each of these contains a small health stimulant. And yes, **Saya** really does call them that.

### Big Stimmy Pack *[Medikit]*

*"Big stimmy, for the bigger ouchies."*

These ones contain all sorts of medical equipment to patch up wounds and treat burns. Fairly useful, certainly.

### Spiritual Stimulant *[Soulsphere]*

*"Glad I'm compatible with these, just like Ibuki is. Means I can jam this shit into my veins without basically blowing myself up in the process. No bullshit ultra failed heals here."*

A single boost of 100 HP with each use. There is no upper cap to how much you can get out of these, although going over 200 HP will make your health drop faster and faster.

### Armor Nugget *[Armor Bonus]*

*"Got these from Tach-Engine. They work exactly as advertised."*

A fine piece from the **Demolitionist** arsenal, now for **Saya** to make use of. Due to her organic body, however, these are absorbed much more efficiently, giving 5 points of armor each, and stacking up to 500%.

### Armor Padding *[Green Armor]*

*"Don't wanna have no accidents, you know..."*

Protection for your head and your joints. The usual stuff you'd wear for a bike ride, basically.

### Shielded Vest *[Blue Armor]*

*"Shit's heavy, but it's worth it to play it safe."*

Thick shielded plating for your chest and back, providing very decent protection.

### Grilled Cheese Sandwich *[Megasphere]*

*"I can't believe this shit actually also works on me. But now I'm afraid I'll go insane like the."*

A full overheal, and full armor, what more could you need? Well, of course, it will also prevent you from dying, I suppose.

### Hammerspace Embiggener *[Backpack]*

*"That nerd... Well, I do guess it's perfectly cromulent to use this."*

Expands the ammo storage of your backpack. As a civilian you can only upgrade four times.

### Shield Orb *[Blursphere]*

*"Ooooooooooooorb..."*

Works as an extra layer of protection on top of all your other armor. Lasts for about three minutes, although its duration will drain the more damage it has to absorb.

### Maximum Bepis *[Berserk]*

*"Good god, you can really TASTE the bepis."*

An energizing, refreshing drink. Gives off some health regen while also enhancing your speed and physical strength.

### Omnisight *[Computer Map]*

*"People worked hard to fill in the data in these... They have all my respect, and their sacrifice won't be in vain."*

Plugged into **Saya**'s tablet, this will fill in the rough outline of the map, as well as marking the locations of exits and keys.

### Red Oni Milk *[Invulnerability]*

*"It's just so strong, it really invigorates you, to the point of making you feel unstoppable after chugging an entire bottle of the stuff. And it tastes excellent to boot."*

Fresh off the big woman herself, this will provide not only a full heal, but also temporary invincibility. Become unstoppable, through the power of giant titties.

### Glow Visor *[Lite-Amp]*

*"My vision is augmented..."*

Night vision goggles that can be toggled *(hey, that rhymes)*.

### Elemental Coating *[Radsuit]*

*"Well, if it works for them, it should work for me."*

Allows you to harmlessly wade through hazardous liquids for a limited time. In the process, it also allows you to breathe underwater.

### Safety Tether *[Chaos Device]*

*"Oh, you thought your little trap would work? TOO BAD!"*

The usual device to escape from anywhere, at any time, while also blasting away everything around you in the process, to add insult to injury.

### Aerial Amulet *[Wings of Wrath]*

*"This kind of thing... Without it I am but a mere human, but with it... Hehehe..."*

Allows you to float in the air at will, boosting yourself with mere thought. In a way, it is comparable to the **Gravity Suppressor**, although its nature is rooted in magic rather than technology. It at least has the advantage of having quite long-lasting power, and allowing you to activate and deactivate its power when needed. It's got enough charge to last for an entire map (or hub in **Hexen**).

---

*"The memories of those days will haunt me forever. Flashing images of my own guts strewn about, of demons feeding on my bones, dying over and over again... My own stubbornness can really put me in danger."*
